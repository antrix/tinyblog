tb - teenyblog, tinyblog, tidbits, whatever.

This is a minimal, feature-free blogging script which I use 
to run http://antrix.net/mini/

There's no database to configure and all your posts are saved in
a single YAML data file. No tags, no web-based ajax post editor
and no pre-defined post types. You do get a nice Atom feed though!

Runs on web.py (http://webpy.org/)

LICENSE: This software is under public domain. 
         Do as you please.
         No guarantees, warranties, yada, yada.

USAGE: First familiarize yourself with how a typical web.py app works.
  Then make config changes in `config.py`. Your posts/entries go in
  `tb.yml`. Just use your favourite text editor to edit the file and 
  create new entries. Entries can use Markdown syntax.
